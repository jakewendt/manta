Manta Structural Variant Caller
===============================

Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped
paired-end sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline
variation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in
tumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores
large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a
single efficient workflow. The method is designed for rapid analysis
on standard compute hardware: NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is
analyzed in less than 20 minutes on a 20 core server, and most WGS
tumor/normal analyses can be completed within 2 hours. Manta combines
paired and split-read evidence during SV discovery and scoring to
improve accuracy, but does not require split-reads or successful
breakpoint assemblies to report a variant in cases where there is
strong evidence otherwise. It provides scoring models for germline
variants in small sets of diploid samples and somatic variants in
matched tumor/normal sample pairs. There is experimental support for
analysis of unmatched tumor samples as well. Manta accepts input read
mappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and indel inferences
in VCF 4.1 format. See the [user guide] [UserGuide] for a full
description of capabilities and limitations, and the [Manta preprint]
[mss] for additional methods and benchmarking details.

Build instructions
------------------

[![Build Status] [tcistatus]] [tcihome]

It is recommended to start from one of the [binary distributions on
the Manta releases page] [releases] if a suitable version is available
(note that the CentOS 5 binary distribution is expected to support a
large variety of linux systems).  If building from source start from
the release distributions of the source code, also provided on the
[Manta releases page] [releases]. Cloning/archiving the source
directly from git could result in missing version number entries,
undesirably stringent build requirements or an unstable development
version between releases. Additional build notes for Manta developers can
be found in the [manta developer guide] [DeveloperGuide]

Note that this README is _NOT_ part of a tagged source-code release.

### Build prerequisites

Manta requires a compiler supporting most of the C++11 standard. These
are the current minimum versions enforced by the build system:

* python 2.4+
* gcc 4.7+ OR clang 3.1+ (OR Visual Studio 2013+, see windows note below)

### Runtime prerequisites

* python 2.4+

### Operating System Guidelines

##### Linux 

Manta is known to build and run on the following linux distributions
(with additional packages as described below):

- Ubuntu 12.04,14.04
- CentOS 5,6,7

##### OS X

Manta builds and passes basic tests on OS X 10.9, but full WGS analyses
are not tested for this platform.

##### Windows

Manta does not build or run on windows. Library-level compilation is
possible for Visual Studio users. See the the [manta developer guide] [DeveloperGuide] for details.

### Linux Package Additions

##### Ubuntu 14.04

    apt-get update -qq
    apt-get install -qq gcc g++ make python

##### Ubuntu 12.04

    apt-get update -qq
    apt-get install -qq bzip2 gcc g++ make python python-software-properties
    # add gcc 4.8 from ubuntu ppa:
    add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    apt-get update -qq
    apt-get install -qq gcc-4.8 g++-4.8

    # Prior to build configuration, set CC/CXX to gcc 4.8:
    export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.8
    export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.8

##### CentOS 7

    yum install -y tar bzip2 make gcc gcc-c++

##### CentOS 5 and 6

    yum install -y tar wget bzip2 make gcc gcc-c++
    # add gcc 4.8 from developer tools v2:
    wget http://people.centos.org/tru/devtools-2/devtools-2.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/devtools-2.repo
    yum install -y devtoolset-2-gcc devtoolset-2-gcc-c++ devtoolset-2-binutils

    # Prior to build configuration, set CC/CXX to gcc 4.8:
    export CC=/opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/gcc
    export CXX=/opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/g++

### Build procedure

After acquiring a release distribution of the source code, the build
procedure is:

* Unpack source code
* Create and move to a separate `build` directory (out-of-source build is required.)
* Configure build
* Compile & Install

Example (building on 4 cores):

    wget https://github.com/Illumina/manta/releases/download/vA.B.C/manta-A.B.C.release_src.tar.bz2
    tar -xjf manta-A.B.C.release_src.tar.bz2
    mkdir build && cd build
    # Ensure that CC and CXX are updated to target compiler if needed, e.g.:
    #     export CC=/path/to/cc
    #     export CXX=/path/to/c++
    ../manta-A.B.C.release_src/src/configure --jobs=4 --prefix=/path/to/install
    make -j4 install

Note that during the configuration step, the following dependencies
will be built from source if they are not found:

* cmake 2.8.0+
* boost 1.56.0+

To accelerate this process the configuration step can be parallelized
over multiple cores, as demonstrated in the example above with the
`--jobs=4` argument to configure.

To see more configure options, run:

    ${MANTA_SRC_PATH}/configure --help

##### Workflow relocation

After Manta is built the installation directory can be relocated to
another directory.  All internal paths used in the workflow are
relative.

### Demo / Build Verification 

To help verify a successful installation, Manta includes a small demo
data set and test script. After completing the installation steps
above, the demo can be run as follows:

    python ${MANTA_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/runMantaWorkflowDemo.py

See [the demo README](src/demo/README.md) for additional information
on the test script and data.


Data analysis and Interpretation
--------------------------------

After completing installation, see the [Manta user guide] [UserGuide]
for instructions on how to run Manta, interpret results, and a
high-level overview of the method.

The user guide is also available within any Manta binary distribution
here:

    ${MANTA_INSTALL_PATH}/doc/html/mantaUserGuide.html

### Runtime hardware requirements

Manta workflows are parallelized at the process level using the
[pyFlow] [pyflow_site] task manager. pyFlow can distrubute Manta
workflows to a specified number of cores on a single host or
SGE-managed cluster.

As a useful runtime benchmark, [Platinum Genomes] [PG] sequencing
reads for NA12878 at 50x coverage (whole genome) can be analyzed in
less than 20 minutes on 20 physical cores using a dual Xeon E5-2680
v2 server with the BAM accessed from a conventional local
drive, peak total memory (RSS) for this run was 2.35 Gb.
Additional hardware notes:

* **Memory** Typical memory requirements are <1Gb/core for germline
analysis and <2Gb/core for cancer/FFPE/highly rearranged
samples. The exact requirement depends on many factors including
sequencing depth, read length, fragment size and sample quality.

* **CPU** Manta does not require or benefit from any specific modern
CPU feature (e.g. NUMA, AVX..), but in general faster clock and
larger caches will improve performance.

* **I/O** I/O can be roughly approximated as 1.1 reads of the
input alignment file per analysis, with no writes that are significant
relative to the alignment file size.
